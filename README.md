This repository consists of codes that are relevant to building a Convolutional Neural Networks.

I've taken part in a few competitions related to Computer Vision and Image Classification so I wanted to share these skeleton codes so that it is easier to reuse and implement these codes for future projects.

I aim to simplify pipelines by integrating all necessary processes into as few scripts as possible.
